## Simple Calculator created with HTML5, CSS3 & ES6

- This is a basic calculator which does basic calculations like ```Addition```, ```Subtraction```, ```Multiplication``` and ```Division```. 
- The calculator will be able to put ```pie```, ```square```, ```sin```, ```cos``` and ```tan```
- I intend to upgrade the calculator with some scientific features.
